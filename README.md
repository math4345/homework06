# üéØ Goal: Sequences

## Objective

This is the first of many "topics" weeks, and our first topic is sequences.

The homework this week is quite challenging.  We will have time during lecture to discuss this material.  The challenge here is that we are mixing together mathematical content (i.e., the definition of convergent sequence) alongside "Lean" content.

## üöÄ Getting Started: Your Step-by-Step Guide

Setting up a new environment often takes more time than expected, so let's break it down into manageable steps.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Accept the GitHub Classroom Assignment

Accept this homework assignment in GitHub Classroom. This will enable
you to clone your own repository.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository

Once the assignment is accepted, clone your new repository to your
local machine.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Project Setup

Follow the [official guide for setting up an existing Lean
project](https://leanprover-community.github.io/install/project.html)
to set up your development environment.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Fetch Prebuilt Dependencies

Run the following command to fetch the pre-built `mathlib` files. This is significantly faster than building `mathlib` on your local machine:

```bash
lake exe cache get
```
